    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Efo Riro is a very popular Yoruba soup in Nigeria, 
        it is one of my favorite Nigerian soups because of its health benefits. 
        The name ‘efo’ means vegetables, hence it is a Yoruba rich vegetable soup.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sliced Spinach leaves (7-10 cups)</li>
        <li>7-10 pieces stock fish ear</li>
        <li>assorted meat (1KG)</li>
        <li>1 cup of sliced/ground tatashe</li>
        <li>quarter cup of sliced pepper</li>
        <li>half cup of sliced onions</li>
        <li>Half Cup of Ground Crayfish</li>
        <li>2-3 spoons of iru (locust beans)</li>
        <li>smoked fish (2-3 medium)</li>
        <li>Palm oil (200ml)</li>
        <li>3 Seasoning cubes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Place the washed meat in a pot, add a little of water, season with salt, 
        sliced onions, 2 seasoning cubes and allow to boil for 10-15 minutes, 
        add 1-2 cups of water and cook till tender and the water is almost dried.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Add the smoked fish, stockfish, add a cup of water and cook for another 10-15 minutes 
        depending on the hardness of your stockfish, I love them when they are very soft. 
        The water should be almost dried, don’t allow to burn.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Remove the pot from heat, place another pot on heat and pour in some palm oil, 200ml. 
        Allow to heat before adding the sliced onions, ground pepper/tatashe, 
        stir and allow to fry for another ten minutes while stirring occasionally to avoid burning.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Add the cooked meat/stock fish/smoked fish, stir and allow to simmer for 5 minutes, 
        add the crayfish, iru, stir and allow another 3 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Add a seasoning cube, salt to taste, stir and add the spinach leaves. 
        Stir all together and allow to simmer for another 3-5 minutes and you 
        just made a delicious pot of efo riro.
